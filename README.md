# workoutH2Angular

This is an older version of my Workout Tracker, using a h2 database. This repository has an undeveloped UI and the project has been dropped in favour of React over Angular.

Within the 'exercises' branch contains a working API side many to many connection between the Exercise and Workout class that can write to the h2 database.
